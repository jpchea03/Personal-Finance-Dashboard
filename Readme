User Input:
To use the user input functions, simply call them with no arguments
then follow the prompts to enter expense information. For each expense entry,
the program prompts the user first for the name and then for the amount.
If the expense amount is valid, the expense is saved to a dictionary where
the keys are the expense names and the values are the amounts. If the amount is invalid,
an error message is displayed. In any case, after expense is entered, the user is asked if they
wish to continue. To stop adding expenses, enter the escape code ('n') at this stage.
